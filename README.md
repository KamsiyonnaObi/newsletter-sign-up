## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

Building this in vanilla javascript helped gain a deeper understanding of React. I understand better the uses of react hooks like useState and useEffect. The most interesting part was tracking the changes without react useState hook

### Continued development

This has sparked my curiousity to deeply understand state management and best practices.
